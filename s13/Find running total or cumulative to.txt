CALCULATE(SUM('Sales Summary'[Gross Sale]),
FILTER('Sales Summary',
'Sales Summary'[Gross Sale]<=EARLIER('Sales Summary'[Gross Sale])))

Find the ranking by using Earlier() dax function ?

coutrowdesc = 
CALCULATE(COUNT('Sales Summary'[Gross Sale]),
FILTER('Sales Summary','Sales Summary'[Gross Sale]>=EARLIER('Sales Summary'[Gross Sale])))

in that we find out the index based on Gross Sale in descending order.

coutrowAsc =
 CALCULATE(COUNT('Sales Summary'[Gross Sale]),
FILTER('Sales Summary','Sales Summary'[Gross Sale]<=EARLIER('Sales Summary'[Gross Sale])))

in that we find out the index based on Gross Sale in ascending order.

crow = 
CALCULATE(COUNT('earlier'[Supplier]),
FILTER('earlier',
AND('earlier'[Apple Phone]=EARLIER('earlier'[Apple Phone]),
'earlier'[Supplier]<=EARLIER('earlier'[Supplier]))))
in that we find out the index based on Apple Phone column and Supplier column.
