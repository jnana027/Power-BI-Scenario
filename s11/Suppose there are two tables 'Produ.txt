Suppose there are two tables: 'Productlist,' which contains one column for 'Product name,' and 'sales summery,' which contains the following columns: 'segment,' 'country,' 'product,' and 'qty sold.

These two tables are connected with each other, meaning there is no direct relationship between them.
1.Which function is helpful for connecting two tables if they are not connected directly through a relationship ?

2.If the two tables are not connected, you can use the 'TREATAS()' function to calculate the total quantity based on the number of products that are present in the 'Productlist' table ?

treatas = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales Summary'[Qty Sold]),TREATAS(VALUES('Product List'[Product Code]),'Sales Summary'[Product]))

Values function return single table or column with unique value.
