Suppose there are two tables: a 'Sales' table containing transaction data from an ecommerce website and a 'Calendar' table containing calendar data from 2020 to 2022.
can you create a measure to show me 
1.What is the total number of customers in a particular range?.
2.What is the total number of customers from last year within a particular range? 
3.Find the common customers within a particular range?


1.Total Number of Customers in a Specific Date Range:


   total customer = COUNTROWS(CALCULATETABLE(VALUES(sale[customer name]),
                        DATESBETWEEN('date'[Date],MIN('date'[Date]),MAX('date'[Date]))))

This measure calculates the total number of unique customers in the Sales table for the selected date range.


2.Total Number of Customers from the Previous Year in a Specific Date Range:
     last year customer = COUNTROWS(CALCULATETABLE(VALUES(sale[customer name]),
                              DATESBETWEEN('date'[Date],MIN('date'[Date])-365,MAX('date'[Date])-365)))


   This measure calculates the total number of unique customers in the Sales table for the same date range in the previous year.


3.Find the Common Customers in a Specific Date Range:
     common customer = COUNTROWS(INTERSECT(CALCULATETABLE(VALUES(sale[customer name]),
                      DATESBETWEEN('date'[Date],MIN('date'[Date]),MAX('date'[Date]))),
                                             CALCULATETABLE(VALUES(sale[customer name]),
                            DATESBETWEEN('date'[Date],MIN('date'[Date])-365,MAX('date'[Date])-365))))


This measure calculates the number of common customers between the current year and the previous year within the specified date range.


Another you also that problem:
1.Total Number of Customers in a Specific Date Range:
  Total Customers = COUNTROWS(SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Customer ID]))

This measure calculates the total number of unique customers in the Sales table for the selected date range.

2.Total Number of Customers from the Previous Year in a Specific Date Range:

Total Customers Last Year = 
VAR SelectedDate = MAX(Calendar[Date])
VAR PreviousYearStartDate = DATEADD(SelectedDate, -1, YEAR)
VAR PreviousYearEndDate = DATEADD(SelectedDate, -1, DAY)
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Customer ID])),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Calendar),
        Calendar[Date] >= PreviousYearStartDate && Calendar[Date] <= PreviousYearEndDate
    )
)

This measure calculates the total number of unique customers in the Sales table for the same date range in the previous year.

3.Find the Common Customers in a Specific Date Range:
Common Customers = 
VAR SelectedDate = MAX(Calendar[Date])
VAR PreviousYearStartDate = DATEADD(SelectedDate, -1, YEAR)
VAR PreviousYearEndDate = DATEADD(SelectedDate, -1, DAY)
VAR CurrentYearCustomers = SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Customer ID])
VAR PreviousYearCustomers = CALCULATETABLE(
    SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Customer ID]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Calendar),
        Calendar[Date] >= PreviousYearStartDate && Calendar[Date] <= PreviousYearEndDate
    )
)
RETURN
COUNTROWS(
    INTERSECT(
        CurrentYearCustomers,
        PreviousYearCustomers
    )
)


This measure calculates the number of common customers between the current year and the previous year within the specified date range.
