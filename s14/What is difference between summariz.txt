What is difference between summarize() and summarizecolumns() in power BI.

Both of these functions are used to create summarised tables.
The difference between the two is that the SUMMARIZE function allows us to have a row and a filter context within the expression whereas the SUMMARIZECOLUMNS function only allows us to have a filter context and no row context.

syn of SUMMARIZECOLUMNS:
   SUMMARIZECOLUMNS( <groupBy_columnName> [, < groupBy_columnName >]…, [<filterTable>]…[, <name>, <expression>]…)


Ex:Create a new table for sales and profits in each region where color is black and Business segment is equal to bike.
   summarize column =       SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(TrainingSample2[Country],
                            FILTER(TrainingSample2,
                           AND(TrainingSample2[Color]="black",TrainingSample2[Business Segment]="bikes")),
                            "Total sales",[total sales],
                            "Total Profit",[Total Profit])

syn of SUMMARIZE:
   SUMMARIZE (<table>, <groupBy_columnName>[, <groupBy_columnName>]…[, <name>, <expression>]…)


Ex:Create a new table for sales and profits in each region.

total sales = SUM(TrainingSample2[sales])

Total Profit = SUMX(TrainingSample2,TrainingSample2[sales]-TrainingSample2[cost])

summarize table = SUMMARIZE(TrainingSample2,TrainingSample2[Country],"total sales",[total sales],"Total Profit",[Total Profit])
