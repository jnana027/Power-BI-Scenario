Given a table with multiple columns, I need to write a DAX expression to create a new table that includes only three columns, each with specific conditions:

Product ID (should be less than or equal to 100).
Product Name (should start with 'S').
Product Price (should be greater than or equal to 500).


Required table = CALCULATETABLE
(SUMMARIZECOLUMNS('product'[Price],'product'[Product id],'product'[Product name ]),
                                         'product'[Price]>=500,
                                        'product'[Product id]<=100,
                                         LEFT(SEARCH("s",'product'[Product name ],1,BLANK()),1))
