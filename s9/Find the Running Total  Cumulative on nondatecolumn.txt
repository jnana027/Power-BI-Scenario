Find the Running Total / Cumulative Total:
Running total based on Non-date column:
Assuming you have a table named "Product" with a non-date column "Productname" and a sales amount column "sale," and you want to calculate running sales based on the "Productname," you can create a DAX measure as follows:
Open your Power BI Desktop or Excel Power Pivot where you are working with your data.

Click on the "Model" view to ensure you are in the Data Model.

In the "Model" view, locate your table (e.g., "Product") and right-click on it. Then, select "New Measure" to create a new DAX measure.

Name your measure (e.g., "Running Sales by Productname").

Enter the following DAX formula to calculate the running sales based on the "Productname":

method 1:
tsale = SUM('product'[SALES])

rsale = 
var a=RANKX(ALL('product'[Product]),[tsale],,DESC,Dense)
var b=CALCULATE([tsale],
FILTER(ALL('product'[Product]),RANKX(ALL('product'[Product]),[tsale],,DESC,Dense)<=a))
return b

method 2:
tsale = SUM('product'[SALES])

cumsales = 
CALCULATE([totalsale],
FILTER(ALL(Sheet1[Product]),Sheet1[Product]<=MAX(Sheet1[Product])))
