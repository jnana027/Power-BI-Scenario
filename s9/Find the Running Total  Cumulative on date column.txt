Find the Running Total / Cumulative Total:
Running total bases date column:
Assuming you have a table named "Rank" with a date column "Date" and a sales amount column "sale," you can create a DAX measure to calculate running sales as follows:
Open your Power BI Desktop or Excel Power Pivot where you are working with your data.

Click on the "Model" view to ensure you are in the Data Model.

In the "Model" view, locate your table (e.g., "Rank") and right-click on it. Then, select "New Measure" to create a new DAX measure.

Name your measure (e.g., "runningsales").

Enter the following DAX formula to calculate the running sales:

runningsales = CALCULATE([totalsales],FILTER(all('date'),'date'[Date]<=MAX('date'[Date])))
                                   OR
cumilativesales = CALCULATE([totalsales],FILTER(ALL('date'[Date]),'date'[Date]<=MAX('date'[Date])))
