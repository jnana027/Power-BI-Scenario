There are two tables: table1 and table2. 
Table1 contains the following columns: state, sub_category, and sales. 
Table2 contains the column: category.

To perform a cross join between these two tables, we can solve the problem using two methods: by using a DAX function and by using Power Query to transform the data.

By using Dax function:
cross = CROSSJOIN(table1,table2) 

Using Power Query:
Follow these steps to achieve a cross join between two tables using Power Query:
1.Open Power Query Editor.
2.Select the first table, navigate to the "Add Column" tab, and click on "Custom Column."
3.Give the custom column a name and specify a value, then click the "OK" button.
4.Select the second table, go to the "Add Column" tab, and click on "Custom Column."
5.Give the custom column the same name and value that you assigned to the first table's custom column, then click "OK."
6.Now, go to the "Home" tab in Power Query and click "Merge Queries."
7.In the Merge Queries dialog box, select the common column you want to join on.
8.Set the join condition to "Inner join (only matching rows)," then click the "OK" button.

By following these steps, you will have successfully performed a cross join between the two tables using Power Query.
